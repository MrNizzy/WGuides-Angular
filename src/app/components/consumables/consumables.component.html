    <p>
        Consumables are very important to temporarily increase our stats, it is highly recommended to use them in Raid
        groups, however, if you want to use them in Dungeons, keep in mind that they can be somewhat expensive to Farm.
        Below you will see the consumable items to improve the stats of your class:

        </a>
        <p>
            The Severed Sagefish Head is the quintessential food for our class, as it grants us 90 intellect
            points for one hour as long as we do not die. The effect should be taken whenever we go to a
            Raid to increase our damage.

            <span>Seafood Magnifique Feast</span>
        </a>
        <p>
            This is another type of food that will help us to obtain 90 points of intellect, however, I
            recommend the first option more because of the ease of obtaining the fish for its manufacture.

        <p>
            These fortune cookies are another alternative, although I don't recommend their harvesting because
            we won't always get the benefit we are looking for.
